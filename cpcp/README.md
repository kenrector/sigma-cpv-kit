Andrews University cpcp system

Note that AU developed a COC LIU that implemented a previously unused COC order (x06) and then patched the CP-V COC handler to use it.  The simh sigma simulator was modified to support this non standard hardware.  Keith Calkins says; 

"Fall 1975 we had 24 lines on our Sigma 6 and Xerox had bailed and Honeywell wasn't going to be able to supply any LIUs so we resorted to making our own.  By X-mas 75 George had bread boarded a prototype which ran 8 lines so we were quickly up to 32, but they allowed variable speed which was set via that WD...  Summer 76 Dan Bidwell a student who was hired soon after me as a freshman that spring did some modelling of characters at various baud rates and the * was selected as the character to determine what line speed was appropriate for our phone lines, generally 110, 300, or 1200 baud, but later increased to 2400 baud."
