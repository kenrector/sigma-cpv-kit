# Introduction

This folder contains files and instructions to install and test the Telefile/Andrews University C compiler dated July, 1986. 

The Telefile -11 document includes this:

TELEFILE C IS FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE VERSION THAT
IS AVAILABLE UNDER UNIX SYSTEM V FROM ATT.  TELEFILE C
SHOULD BE A SUPERSET OF THE VERSIONS THAT MAY BE FOUND
ON MANY MINI AND MICRO COMPUTERS.  THIS COMPILER IS
LICENSED FROM ATT.

There is no source code available for the compiler.  I found several external DEF labels in the
compiler ROMs that match external symbols in a
SysVR2 package from an internet archive.
