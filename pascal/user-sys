**********************************************************
 
   TO BRING PASCAL UP ON YOUR SYSTEM SIMPLY BATCH LOAD:J.
   THIS WILL LOAD  MAIN:R,PHASE1:R,PHASE2:R,PASCAL:R AND
   THE SYSTEM JIT DEFINITION AND CREATE A LOAD MODULE
   CALLED NPASCAL. NPASCAL IS THE PASCAL COMPILER.
 
   IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT PASCAL REQUIRES JIT INFORMATION
  AND THEREFORE MUST BE RELOADED WHENEVER A NEW VERSION
  OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM IS BROUGHT UP.
 
 
  NOTE: THE SOURCES SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE RE-ASSEMBLED
       AS ALL THE ROMS ARE CURRENT. THE SOURCES ARE PROVIDED
       FOR YOUR CONVINIENCE.
 
***************************************************************
 
  PASCAL HAS THE FOLLOWING UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES:
    1.) PACK-UNPACK
    2.) THE PROCEDURE RELEASE FOR DYNAMIC STORAGE.
         ANY STORAGE RELEASED WILL BE LOST.
    3.) THE SECOND FORMAT ARGUMENT IN A REAL WRITE.
         THE FIELD WIDTH MAY BE SPECIFIED BUT NOT THE
        DECIMAL FIELD WIDTH.
 
**********************************************************
 
   TO RUN, THE COMPILER REQUIRES:
     1.) PASCLIB.:SYS   THIS IS THE STANDARD INTERPRETER
         ROM CREATED BY PASCLIB:J WHICH IS MOVED TO THE
         OUTPUT FILE THE  COMPILER CREATES (THE ROM).
     2.) PASCERR.:SYS   THIS IS A KEYED FILE OF ERROR
         MESSAGES FOR BOTH THE COMPILER AND INDIVIDUAL
         PROGRAMS TO USE.  (SEE BELOW ON CREATION AND
         MAINTENANCE OF ERROR FILE).
 
*******************************************************
 
           ERROR FILE HANDLER
 
     THE PROGRAM 'EHAN' MAINTAINS THE PASCAL KEYED ERROR
  MESSAGE FILE, 'PASCERR.:SYS', WHICH THE PASCAL COMPILER
  USES TO WRITE THE TEXT FOR THE SOURCE ERROR NUMBERS WHEN
  THE E+ OPTION IS SPECIFIED.
 
 
     THE PROGRAM WILL DO THE FOLLOWING:
 
  1. LIST THE ENTIRE ERROR FILE IN NUMERICAL ORDER.
  2. INSERT NEW RECORDS.
  3. DELETE OLD RECORDS.
  4. REPLACE EXISTING RECORDS.
  5. LIST A RECORD
 
 
     THE FORMAT FOR USE OF THE PROGRAM IS AS FOLLOWS:
 
  COL. 1    COL. 2-5    6       COL. 7-? (<=80)
  COMMAND   E-NUMBER    :       MESSAGE
 
 
     THE COMMAND IS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING LETTERS:
 
  L - LIST (WITH E-NUMBER LISTS THAT ERROR, WITHOUT
            LISTS THE WHOLE FILE)
  I - INSERT
  D - DELETE
  R - REPLACE
 
 
     THE E-NUMBER IS THE FOUR DIGIT ERROR NUMBER BY WHICH
  THE COMPILER REFERS TO THE MESSAGE.  NUMBERS 1-999 ARE
  THE SOURCE ERRORS.  2000-2999 ARE MESSAGES USED BY THE
  PASCAL INTERPRETER.  5000-5999 ARE USED BY THE COMPILER
  FOR ERRORS OTHER THAN SOURCE ERRORS.  7000-7999 ARE FOR
  MONITOR ERRORS.
 
 
     THE E-NUMBER IS FOLLOWED BY A ':'.
 
 
     THE MESSAGE IS ANY LENGTH LESS THAN 74 CHARACTERS.
 
 
     THESE UPDATE RECORDS ARE THEN USED AS NORMAL DATA FOR
  THE LOAD MODULE.
 
    EXAMPLE:
       TO INSERT 5001,DELETE 28,INSERT 325 AND LIST THE FILE
     THE RECORDS WOULD BE:
 
I5011: -- COMPILATION COMPLETE --
D28:
I0325: COMPARISON OF STRING TO ARRAY NOT IMPLEMENTED
L
 
************************************************************
 
      ON OUR SYSTEM IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE PASCAL
   A SHARED PROCESSOR. AS A SHARED PROCESSOR EACH
   PASCAL USER REQUIRES ONLY 12-15 K INSTEAD OF THE
   25-30 K REQUIRED TO GIVE EACH USER HIS OWN COPY.
 
**********************************************************
 
   PASCAL HAS AN ADDED OPTION, THE Z OPTION, SPECIFICALLY
  FOR COMPILATION OF THE COMPILER. THE DEFAULT IS '+'.
  IF THE Z- OPTION IS USED, THE COMPILER WILL NOT MOVE THE
  INTERPRETER INTO THE ROM IT CREATES AND THE ROM
  MAY THEN BE LOADED WITH PHASE1,PHASE2 AND THE MAINLINE.
 
 
**********************************************************
 
     THE STANDARD PROCEDURE ERROR IS ALSO AVAILABLE
   TO THE COMPILER. IN THE COMPILER IT MAY  HAVE
   AN INTEGER ARGUMENT. THE ARGUMENTS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED
   ARE:
       0.) SOURCE ERROR.
       1.) Z- OPTION SPECIFIED.
       2.) C- OPTION SPECIFIED.
       3.) P+ OPTION (TOP OF PAGE IN SOURCE LISTING).
       4.) UNEXPECTED END OF SOURCE FILE
 
   OTHER INTEGER ARGUMENTS WILL BE IGNORED.
 
**************************************************************
 
      THE MSU COMPUTING CENTER IS NOT IN A POSITION TO
   SUPPORT THIS PROCESSOR. IT IS SENT TO YOU WITH THAT
   UNDERSTANDING. HOWEVER, SPECIAL CONSIDERATION IN THE
   WAY OF FIXES,NEW VERSIONS,ETC.. WILL BE GIVEN TO
   THOSE WHO SUPPLY US WITH SOME FEEDBACK(POSITIVE OR
   NEGATIVE) ON HOW PASCAL IS RUNNING AT THEIR INSTALLATION.
    WE ALSO ASK THAT OTHER INSTALLATIONS DESIRING PASCAL
   BE REFERRED TO US .
   CORRESPONDENCE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO:
