                        These are the important parts of SIGMA.CFG I used.
                        Even some of this is unimportant, but I left it 
                        anyway.

                       no problem with bad coc---just missing hardware.
                       What concerns me is did GJOB PATCHIT run?
                       I think not since I had backspace problems while
                       editing the file.  This could explain my crashes
                       since it has some important patches.  PATCHIT
                       was a ghost we invented to allow dynamic patching.
                       9DIAG ran many of the Sigma 9 CPU diagnostics
                       every 5 hours or so.  There were some intermittants
                       I was chasing.  Later I was able to use it to get
                       test cases into Madhu's Java-based emulator.

                       Output from user 6, the DAY ghost, is useful.
                       DAY originated as a way to get the date on the TY listing.
                       Later it became a catch all to start other ghosts
                       and otherwise monitor things like noting restricted
                       usage (ON 0 not ON 107), storage (granules, symboiont)
                       Memory size, uptime, etc.

                Note: to get the prompt above I hit F1

                Later I changed this with ANLZ/DELTA to reduce the

                We had laser printers (HP's) as serial lines and that
                is what logged on first below.
                
                I then tried to log into :SYS but failed and that got logged.

                This is a multi-purpose processor we developed
                whis allows you to look/manipulate symbionts.
                When called as SPOOL or UNSPOOL it moved symbionts
                to/from tape.
                PACKP used a file called PACKSV to help keep the
                operators from removing private packs which were
                basically permanently mounted and thus wreaking havoc.

                This program has a problem---there is nothing
                to tell it how many characters to print, but
                without my batch manual I couldn't instantly fix it
                so please don't submit it to the helloworld database.
                I think what it needs is a (BTD,1),(SIZE,*4) and
                a LB,4 B#BUF before the write.
